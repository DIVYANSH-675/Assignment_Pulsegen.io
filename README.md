# AI Agent for Swiggy App Review Trend Analysis

This project builds an AI system that analyzes Google Play Store reviews for **Swiggy** (a popular food delivery app in India) and creates daily trend reports. The system automatically finds issues, requests, and feedback from thousands of reviews and tracks how they change over time.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**API KEY NOTICE:** The API keys used in this project's code are **REVOKED** and will not work. 

**You must use your own OpenAI API key to run this project.**

See the "Quick Start" section below for instructions on setting up your API key.

## 📋 What Was The Assignment?

**Task:** Build an AI agent that analyzes Google Play reviews and generates daily trend reports.

**Requirements:**
- Take reviews from June 2024 till date for **Swiggy app** (food delivery app)
- Process reviews in daily batches
- Track topics (issues, requests, feedback) over 30 days
- Create a trend report showing how topics change over time
- Use AI agents (not traditional topic modeling)
- Find new topics automatically
- Combine similar topics to avoid duplicates

**Output:** A table showing:
- Rows: Topics (like "Delivery issue", "Food stale", etc.)
- Columns: Dates from T-30 to T (last 30 days)
- Cells: How many times each topic appeared on each date

**Assignment Duration:** 24 hours

## ✅ What Did I Deliver?

I built a complete AI system with these features:

1. **Review Processing Pipeline** - Cleans and processes 264,000+ reviews
2. **AI Topic Detection** - Uses LLM (Large Language Model) to identify topics from reviews
3. **Novel Topic Discovery** - Automatically finds new topics not in the initial list
4. **Topic Deduplication** - Combines similar topics together (e.g., "Delivery guy was rude" + "Delivery partner behaved badly" → "Delivery partner rude")
5. **30-Day Trend Reports** - Shows how topics change over the last 30 days
6. **Daily Reports** - Generates CSV and HTML reports automatically

## 📊 Final Output

Here's what the trend report looks like:

![Topic Trends Report](output/Output.png)

*Note: Take a screenshot of your HTML report (`output/topics_trend_2025-10-28.html`) and save it as `output/topics_trend_screenshot.png`*

The report shows:
- **Topic names** (what people are complaining about or praising)
- **Sparklines** (mini charts showing trends)
- **7-day change** (how topics increased or decreased in the last week)
- **Daily counts** (exact numbers for each topic each day)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Setup

1. **Install Python packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set YOUR API key** (⚠️ You must use your own API key)
   
   **Option A: Use OpenAI API**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key-here"
   ```
   
   **Option B: Use Megallm API**
   ```bash
   export MEGALLM_API_KEY="sk-mega-your-key-here"
   export MEGALLM_BASE_URL="https://ai.megallm.io/v1"
   ```
   
   **Note:** Get your API key from:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Megallm: Their official website

3. **Run the pipeline**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/00_complete_pipeline.ipynb
   ```

That's it! The system will automatically:
- Load and clean the reviews
- Detect topics using AI
- Generate trend reports
- Save results to the `output/` folder

## 📝 Notebook Usage

**Use `notebooks/` folder** if you want to use cloud AI APIs (OpenAI, Megallm)
- Recommended for faster processing
- Requires API key and internet connection
- Costs money per API call

**Use `Notebook2/` folder** if you want to use local LLM (Ollama)
- Free (no API costs)
- Slower processing
- Needs Ollama installed locally
- Good for testing small samples

## 🔄 How It Works (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Load and Clean Data**
- Takes raw reviews from CSV file
- Removes bad data and cleans up text
- Saves cleaned data (225,000 valid reviews)

**Step 2: Find Topics**
- Uses AI to read each review
- Decides which topics match the review
- Each review can have multiple topics
- Saves results day by day

**Step 3: Combine Similar Topics**
- Looks for topics that mean the same thing
- Example: "Delivery guy was rude" and "Delivery person was impolite" → Same topic
- Saves a list of what topics to combine

**Step 4: Create Trend Report**
- Counts how many times each topic appeared each day
- Shows trends over 30 days
- Creates CSV and HTML reports

**How Similar Topics Are Combined:**
1. Uses AI embeddings to understand topic meaning
2. Compares similarity scores
3. Combines topics with similarity > 82%
4. Uses AI to review uncertain cases

## 📊 Sample Output

**CSV Report** shows:
```csv
topic_id,2025-09-28,2025-09-29,...,2025-10-25,7d_change_pct
POSITIVE_EXPERIENCE,412,219,...,228,-5.41%
LATE_DELIVERY,60,55,...,43,-10.17%
MONEY_ALREADY_EATEN,17,15,...,16,9.76%
```

**HTML Report** shows:
- Visual sparklines (mini charts)
- Color-coded trends (green = increasing, red = decreasing)
- Sortable tables
- Interactive filters

## 📚 Requirements

Install these packages:
```
polars>=0.20.0          # Data processing
duckdb>=0.10.0          # Analytics
openai>=1.10.0          # AI API
sentence-transformers>=2.5.0  # Embeddings
jupyter>=1.1.0          # Notebooks
tqdm>=4.66.0            # Progress bars
```

Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues (Most Common Problem):**
```bash
# Check if API key is set
echo $MEGALLM_API_KEY
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# IMPORTANT: Use YOUR own API key (the ones in the code are revoked)
# Set the API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"  # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# OR
export MEGALLM_API_KEY="sk-mega-your-key-here"
```

**If you get "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid API Key":**
- The API keys in the project code are revoked and won't work
- You MUST get your own API key
- See the "Quick Start" section for instructions

**Import Errors:**
```python
# In notebook, add this at the top
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
```

**Cache Issues:**
- Delete `notebooks/cache.db` if you get caching problems
- The cache helps save money by reusing API responses

## 🎓 Understanding The Results

**What to look for in the trend report:**

1. **Popular Topics** - Topics with high counts need attention
2. **Growing Trends** - Topics with green (positive) change percentages are increasing
3. **Improving Issues** - Topics with red (negative) change percentages are decreasing
4. **Novel Topics** - Watch the NOVEL topic to find new issues emerging

**Example:**
- "Late Delivery" with -10% means complaints about late delivery decreased by 10% in the last 7 days (good!)
- "Money Already Eaten" with +9.8% means this issue increased by 9.8% (needs attention!)
